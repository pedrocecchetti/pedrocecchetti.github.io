&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I do respect and find it legitimate the decision of People that do not want to have kids&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I understand that kids can sometimes be inconvenient for some living standards (they are noisy, cannot regulate themselves easily)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Saying that lets go to the text&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Throughout the book there are some Challenges proposed to the reader as well as exercises to to practice some concepts learned through the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also Tips that translates the ideas of each one the sections. There are some really useful tips like &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CbvenMRsiF5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">this one&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="chapter-1-2-and-3">Chapter 1, 2 and 3&amp;hellip;&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>These chapters were a very nice beginning for this adventure and left me already with a lot to think, and most important, &lt;strong>to do!&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reading Pragmatic Programmer</title><link>http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/pragprog1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 10:41:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/pragprog1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="it-was-already-time">It was already time!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I had a copy of the &lt;strong>Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/strong>, in a PDF shitty format. And that was my excuse to no read it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have always been keen of the philosoy to credit people for their work. I understand that in Brazil leisure is not that accessible as in other places in the world so I don&amp;rsquo;t blame people buying recorded movies from cinemas. I understand the struggle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I will continue to study Elixir</title><link>http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/iwillcontinuestudyingelixir/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 21:48:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/iwillcontinuestudyingelixir/</guid><description>&lt;p>I took part in a selection process in a company that I was really interested in working with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process till the last interview was smooth and pretty nice. The end I was a little bit frustrated because was not selected to continue in the process but in the end it was very important for me in a way and I will explain why.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="prologue">Prologue&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I think it is important to point out that I am a &lt;strong>Quereinsteiger&lt;/strong> and came from the chemical Engineering area, so I am probably not the profile you search if you want someone with fluent IT theoretical and algorithmy knowledge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Like HSM teached us, 'This is me'</title><link>http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/startpost/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 14:53:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/startpost/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2hgw7sgwwII4oSZf36/giphy.gif" alt="this is me" />

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is pretty hard to start a text to talk about yourself, even more difficult is to write an introduction about atext that talk about yourself, but let&amp;rsquo;s do it! ðŸ˜Ž&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This text will containt what made me come to where I am right now. This is merely an selfanalysis that I decided to transform in a Blog Post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you like long stories, you are welcome to &lt;strong>read through it&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
