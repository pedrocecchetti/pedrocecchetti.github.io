[{"content":"Introduction It is pretty hard to start a text to talk about yourself, even more difficult is to write an introduction about atext that talk about yourself, but let\u0026rsquo;s do it! üòé\nThis text will containt what made me come to where I am right now. This is merely an selfanalysis that I decided to transform in a Blog Post.\nSo if you like long stories, you are welcome to read through it!\nUniversity Yes, I was very good at Chemistry and Physics and ok at math, so my logical choice was :\n- Computer Science - Gastronomy - Medical Sciences - Theater + Chemical Enginnering + Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro Yes, I have chosen my professional path based on experience from some other people! (My dad, my uncle, some cousins)\nIt took me around 7 years (in those there is 1 year Exchange in Germany) to finish it. I struggled a lot, but as my Family always said.\n Finish it, get your certificate and your life will be much easier\n After leaving, I never heard of chemistry again Carrer My career path was not very linear.\nI started as a Technical recruiter. After my first interview, I was like a dizzy coackroach very lost and I decided myself to have a basic understanding of every single theme that those people were talking about: Python, Script, compiling, Kubernetes, deploy, server, frontend, functional programmming, elixir, OOP, backend and it goes.\nFor my surprise, that was not a problem and become my favourite task in my work as a technical recruiter. It was my first trigger to see that I really enjoyed coding and that I really wanted to learn more from that.\nI studied üêçPython for around 1 year. I did a duacity course, did some small personal projects, did courses on Udemy, but what really brought me to another level was being part of a freelance job with a Friend.\n Thank you Luiz! without you I would never had came so far!\n After this tudying time I decided to start to apply for developer positions and found a place where I also evolved a lot.\n Thanks to Fabio, Silvino and He-man I developed myself a lot and really understood how do shit in git work in a team was really like!\n  I also have kudos for Leo one of the craziest and more skilled Frontend Developer I met.\n Personal Life Before that time, that I was studying to be a developer I met my wife in a Disney Exchange Program. She proposed to me in a Escape game. We got married in 2 years and now we are living in Germany and have already one 4-month-old daughter.\nWe came to Germany with no specific plan because we really wanted better life Quality. But I think that should be material for a new Post. See you soon!\n","permalink":"http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/startpost/","summary":"Introduction It is pretty hard to start a text to talk about yourself, even more difficult is to write an introduction about atext that talk about yourself, but let\u0026rsquo;s do it! üòé\nThis text will containt what made me come to where I am right now.
