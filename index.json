So a more technical approach to the pragmatic philosophy.\nIf I could summarize in one sentence it would be:\nThink when you write your code. Don't type only. Chapter 3 This is a very nice chapter that made me think a lot in the tools that I use in my day by day. How to make sure your interactions with your tools are efficient.\nIf I could summarize in one sentence it would be:\nUse your tools wisely. You should configure them, not the other way around! That pretty much summarizes my ideas till now with the book. I am now really trying to make sutr the tools I use help me out on my job. This is very valuable advice!\nSee you on the next post. 🚀\n","permalink":"http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/pragprog2/","summary":"New points for the book Throughout the book there are some Challenges proposed to the reader as well as exercises to to practice some concepts learned through the book.\nThere is also Tips that translates the ideas of each one the sections.

I understand that in Brazil leisure is not that accessible as in other places in the world so I don\u0026rsquo;t blame people buying recorded movies from cinemas. I understand the struggle.\nBut in the last years, as I am being a little bit more comfortable with my financial situation I am making sure to credit people their work. And that\u0026rsquo;s is one of the reasons why I bought Fluent Python and Pragmatic programmer books.\nLuciano Ramalhos work on fluent python is pretty awesome, but I am here to write about something little less language specific. So lets head to it!\nForeword and Surprises As a book that is pretty influencial in our industry I decided that I should buy because really find it a shame to not have read it.\nIn the end the book came with a lot of surprises:\nIt has new material and new information that was not in the first edition The examples uses modern languages like Elixir, Python, Ruby, Javascript and on it goes In summary, a lot of value inside the book and I am pretty excited to share it Also already seen that there are some tips that will probably make my carreer being more consistent with who am I I will try to do some other posts explaining and talking about what I found so valuablr in reading this book.\nI hope you enjoy the next posts! :)\n","permalink":"http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/pragprog1/","summary":"It was already time!

The end I was a little bit frustrated because was not selected to continue in the process but in the end it was very important for me in a way and I will explain why.\nPrologue I think it is important to point out that I am a Quereinsteiger and came from the chemical Engineering area, so I am probably not the profile you search if you want someone with fluent IT theoretical and algorithmy knowledge.\nI am really trying to improve myself on the theoretical part of the IT but the way I entered the area made me \u0026lsquo;care\u0026rsquo; more in solving real life problems.\nThe Interview On the interview they gave me a task and said to solve in a programming language that I felt comfortable. In the moment I was studying elixir and it seemed to me that I would be able to solve the first task easily even with a language that was not my strongest one.\nI chose elixir because of the test approach of the language. I really want to improve myself in testing.\nI did it! Solved the first task. The second task was a little bit harder and I was really keen to change to python. One of the evaluators said\n\u0026lsquo;Try in elixir! No, do what you think it is better\u0026rsquo;\nI thought they really found valuable that I was not on my comfort zone and kept trying with Elixir.\nIn this task I was a little bit confused with some Enum functions and could not deliver the complete solution. We discussed a little bit and at the end, my test suite passed successfully.\nAnd the last task was some very algorithmy question that I was naturally not able to answer because my lack of deep Algorithm knowledge.\nFeedback They didn\u0026rsquo;t pick me because I am very fresh.(They had My CV obviously I am fresh) They said that I should use a more common language in selection Process. (Again they insisted for to use it during interview) They said that my German was pretty amazing. (I don\u0026rsquo;t even care and asked for this FB. I had a similar feeling as here) Conclusion Don\u0026rsquo;t listen to evaluators in interviews. In the end they will make it look like you did wrong choices when they supported you onto choosing that. If you are going to a company where a lot of people are working with the same technologies for decades and have no interest into bleeding edge tech, do the task with commonly used technologies. Otherwise you could scare those people. Stick to your learning plan and make sure to not listen to people that are in they comfort zone since they were born.

This is merely an selfanalysis that I decided to transform in a Blog Post.\nSo if you like long stories, you are welcome to read through it!\nUniversity Yes, I was very good at Chemistry and Physics and ok at math, so my logical choice was :\n- Computer Science - Gastronomy - Medical Sciences - Theater + Chemical Enginnering + Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro Yes, I have chosen my professional path based on experience from some other people! (My dad, my uncle, some cousins)\nIt took me around 7 years (in those there is 1 year Exchange in Germany) to finish it. I struggled a lot, but as my Family always said.\nFinish it, get your certificate and your life will be much easier\nAfter leaving, I never heard of chemistry again Carrer My career path was not very linear.\nI started as a Technical recruiter. After my first interview, I was like a dizzy coackroach very lost and I decided myself to have a basic understanding of every single theme that those people were talking about: Python, Script, compiling, Kubernetes, deploy, server, frontend, functional programmming, elixir, OOP, backend and it goes.\nFor my surprise, that was not a problem and become my favourite task in my work as a technical recruiter. It was my first trigger to see that I really enjoyed coding and that I really wanted to learn more from that.\nI studied 🐍Python for around 1 year. I did a duacity course, did some small personal projects, did courses on Udemy, but what really brought me to another level was being part of a freelance job with a Friend.\nThank you Luiz! without you I would never had came so far!\nAfter this tudying time I decided to start to apply for developer positions and found a place where I also evolved a lot.\nThanks to Fabio, Silvino and He-man I developed myself a lot and really understood how do shit in git work in a team was really like!\nI also have kudos for Leo one of the craziest and more skilled Frontend Developer I met.\nPersonal Life Before that time, that I was studying to be a developer I met my wife in a Disney Exchange Program. She proposed to me in a Escape game. We got married in 2 years and now we are living in Germany and have already one 4-month-old daughter.\nWe came to Germany with no specific plan because we really wanted better life Quality.
