[{"content":"I took part in a selection process in a company that I was really interested in working with.\nThe process till the last interview was smooth and pretty nice. The end I was a little bit frustrated because was not selected to continue in the process but in the end it was very important for me in a way and I will explain why.\nPrologue I think it is important to point out that I am a Quereinsteiger and came from the chemical Engineering area, so I am probably not the profile you search if you want someone with fluent IT theoretical and algorithmy knowledge.\nI am really trying to improve myself on the theoretical part of the IT but the way I entered the area made me \u0026lsquo;care\u0026rsquo; more in solving real life problems.\nThe Interview On the interview they gave me a task and said to solve in a programming language that I felt comfortable. In the moment I was studying elixir and it seemed to me that I would be able to solve the first task easily even with a language that was not my strongest one.\nI chose elixir because of the test approach of the language. I really want to improve myself in testing.\n I did it! Solved the first task.  The second task was a little bit harder and I was really keen to change to python. One of the evaluators said\n \u0026lsquo;Try in elixir! No, do what you think it is better\u0026rsquo;\n I thought they really found valuable that I was not on my comfort zone and kept trying with Elixir.\nIn this task I was a little bit confused with some Enum functions and could not deliver the complete solution. We discussed a little bit and at the end, my test suite passed successfully.\nAnd the last task was some very algorithmy question that I was naturally not able to answer because my lack of deep Algorithm knowledge.\nFeedback  They didn\u0026rsquo;t pick me because I am very fresh.(They had My CV obviously I am fresh) They said that I should use a more common language in selection Process. (Again they insisted for to use it during interview) They said that my German was pretty amazing. (I don\u0026rsquo;t even care and asked for this FB. I had a similar feeling as here)  Conclusion  Don\u0026rsquo;t listen to evaluators in interviews. In the end they will make it look like you did wrong choices when they supported you onto choosing that. If you are going to a company where a lot of people are working with the same technologies for decades and have no interest into bleeding edge tech, do the task with commonly used technologies. Otherwise you could scare those people. Stick to your learning plan and make sure to not listen to people that are in they comfort zone since they were born.

This is merely an selfanalysis that I decided to transform in a Blog Post.\nSo if you like long stories, you are welcome to read through it!\nUniversity Yes, I was very good at Chemistry and Physics and ok at math, so my logical choice was :\n- Computer Science - Gastronomy - Medical Sciences - Theater + Chemical Enginnering + Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro Yes, I have chosen my professional path based on experience from some other people! (My dad, my uncle, some cousins)\nIt took me around 7 years (in those there is 1 year Exchange in Germany) to finish it. I struggled a lot, but as my Family always said.\n Finish it, get your certificate and your life will be much easier\n After leaving, I never heard of chemistry again Carrer My career path was not very linear.\nI started as a Technical recruiter. After my first interview, I was like a dizzy coackroach very lost and I decided myself to have a basic understanding of every single theme that those people were talking about: Python, Script, compiling, Kubernetes, deploy, server, frontend, functional programmming, elixir, OOP, backend and it goes.\nFor my surprise, that was not a problem and become my favourite task in my work as a technical recruiter. It was my first trigger to see that I really enjoyed coding and that I really wanted to learn more from that.\nI studied üêçPython for around 1 year. I did a duacity course, did some small personal projects, did courses on Udemy, but what really brought me to another level was being part of a freelance job with a Friend.\n Thank you Luiz! without you I would never had came so far!\n After this tudying time I decided to start to apply for developer positions and found a place where I also evolved a lot.\n Thanks to Fabio, Silvino and He-man I developed myself a lot and really understood how do shit in git work in a team was really like!\n  I also have kudos for Leo one of the craziest and more skilled Frontend Developer I met.\n Personal Life Before that time, that I was studying to be a developer I met my wife in a Disney Exchange Program. She proposed to me in a Escape game. We got married in 2 years and now we are living in Germany and have already one 4-month-old daughter.\nWe came to Germany with no specific plan because we really wanted better life Quality. But I think that should be material for a new Post. See you soon!\n","permalink":"http://pedrocecchetti.github.io/posts/startpost/","summary":"Introduction It is pretty hard to start a text to talk about yourself, even more difficult is to write an introduction about atext that talk about yourself, but let\u0026rsquo;s do it! üòé\nThis text will containt what made me come to where I am right now.
